   "content":"- Coinbase plans to launch a new Amex credit card in the U.S. offering up to 4% bitcoin cashback to its most loyal users.\n- card\u2019s design is etched with Bitcoin\u2019s Genesis Block and references the \u201ccoinbase\u201d transaction, signaling a clear appeal to bitcoin enthusiasts.\n- While Coinbase\u2019s approach is highly bitcoin-focused, it will face competition from existing crypto rewards cards like Gemini\u2019s.\n\nCoinbase is preparing to launch a new American Express credit card in the U.S. this fall, and everything about it \u2014 from the design to the rewards \u2014 seems tailored to bitcoin enthusiasts.\nUnlike most crypto-linked cards, Coinbase\u2019s upcoming product isn\u2019t just about perks \u2014 it\u2019s about symbolism.\nThe card is etched with data from the Genesis Block, the very first block ever created on the Bitcoin network by pseudonymous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto on Jan. 3, 2009. That single block launched the Bitcoin blockchain and marked the beginning of an entirely new financial system.\nThe inclusion of this data is more than a design choice \u2014 it\u2019s a direct reference to Bitcoin\u2019s founding moment. The hexadecimal code printed on the card is part of the raw data from that first block.\nFor non-technical readers, hexadecimal (or \u201chex\u201d) is simply a base-16 numbering system used in computing. It\u2019s the digital language in which Bitcoin\u2019s original history was written \u2014 and now, it\u2019s literally etched into a physical financial product.\nEmbedded in that block was a now-famous message taken from a Times newspaper headline published on the same day: \u201cChancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d\nNakamoto included it as both a timestamp and a statement of purpose \u2014 a critique of central bank money creation and the failures of the traditional financial system during the 2008 crisis. It has since become a rallying cry for Bitcoin supporters who see the cryptocurrency as an antidote to centralized monetary power.\nEven the card\u2019s name \u2014 Coinbase \u2014 is steeped in Bitcoin\u2019s DNA. In blockchain terminology, a \u201ccoinbase transaction\u201d is the first transaction in each new block, through which new bitcoin is created and awarded to miners.\nIt\u2019s a foundational part of how the network operates, and by adopting the term, Coinbase is tying its brand directly to Bitcoin\u2019s most essential function: the creation of new money without a central authority.\nTaken together, these design choices are meant to resonate with a specific audience: those who value Bitcoin not just as an asset, but as a philosophy \u2014 one rooted in financial sovereignty, resistance to censorship, and distrust of legacy banking systems.\nThe Coinbase One Amex card will be available exclusively to subscribers of Coinbase One, the company\u2019s paid membership program. Eligible cardholders will be able to earn up to 4% cashback in bitcoin on purchases, with rewards scaling based on the assets they hold on Coinbase.\nThe card will carry no foreign transaction fees and can be repaid using either a linked bank account or crypto held on the platform. Cardholders will also gain access to standard American Express perks, including exclusive offers and events.\nCoinbase says that bitcoin rewards earned through spending won\u2019t appear on 1099 tax forms, although taxes may apply if those rewards are later sold.\nWhile Coinbase is emphasizing bitcoin\u2019s heritage in its marketing, crypto rewards cards are not new.\nGemini, for example, launched a credit card in 2023 that offers up to 3% crypto cashback on purchases and supports a variety of digital assets, from bitcoin and ether to stablecoins.\nThe difference is in positioning: Gemini markets its product as a convenient spending tool for earning crypto rewards, while Coinbase is framing its Amex card as something more symbolic \u2014 a way to align everyday financial activity with Bitcoin\u2019s founding ethos.\nThat distinction could matter. For users who simply want exposure to multiple cryptocurrencies, existing cards may remain more appealing. But for those who see themselves as part of the Bitcoin story \u2014 or want to be \u2014 Coinbase is betting that ideology and identity will be as powerful a draw as cashback percentages.\n- Combined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025\n- Gate exchange emerged as major player with 98.9% volume surge to $746 billion, overtaking Bitget to become fourth-largest platform\n- Open interest across centralized derivatives exchanges rose 4.92% to $187 billion\n\n- China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) says the measures refine export controls and are not bans, with licensing for qualifying civilian trade.\n- The ministry may consider general licenses or exemptions and expects very limited supply-chain impact.\n- Beijing pushed back on U.S. tariff and software-control threats, urging talks while warning of resolute measures if Washington escalates.\n\nDisclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.
